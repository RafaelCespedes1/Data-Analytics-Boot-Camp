          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <h4>Poverty and Lacks Healthcare:</h4>
          <p>There is a clear correlation between the percentage of people living in poverty and the percentage of people who lack healthcare coverage.  It is evident from the chart that the higher the percentage of people in a state that live in poverty, the higher the percentage of people who lack healthcare coverage.</p>
          <h4>Poverty and Smokers: </h4>
          <p>There is also a correlation between the percentage of people living in poverty and the percentage of people who are smokers. The higher the percentage of people who live in poverty in a given state, the higher the percentage of inhabitants of that given state that are smokers.</p>
          <h4>Poverty and Obesity:</h4>
          <p>There is also a correlation between the percentage of people living in poverty and the percentage of people who are obese. The higher the percentage of people who live in poverty in a given state, the higher the percentage of inhabitants of that given state who are obese.</p>
          <h4>Median Age and Lacks Healthcare:</h4>
          <p>There is no correlation between the median age of a state and that state's percentage of its population who lack healthcare.</p>
          <h4>Median Age and Smokers:</h4>
          <p>There seems to be a correlation between a state's population median age and the percentage of the state's population who are smokers.</p>
          <h4>Median Age and Obesity:</h4>
          <p>There is no correlation between a state's population median age and the percentage of that state's population who are obese.</p>
          <h4>Median Household Income and Lacks Healthcare:</h4>
          <p>There seems to be a week negative correlation between the level of median household income in a state and that state's percentage of its population who lack healthcare.</p>
          <h4>Median Household Income and Smokers:</h4>
          <p>There is a negative correlation between the median household income of a state and that state's percentage of its population who are smokers. In other words, the higher a state's median household income is, then the lower the percentage of inhabitants of that state who are smokers.</p>
          <h4>Median Household Income and Obesity:</h4>
          <p>There also seems to be a weak negative correlation between the median household income of a state and that state's percentage of its population who are obese.  In other words, the higher the state's median household income is, then the lower that state's percentage of its population who are obese. </p>

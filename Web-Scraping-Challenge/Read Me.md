This is for the Web Scraping Challenge.
The app.py file opens up the web browser and when user presses the scrape new data button,
then the scrape_mars.py file does the scraping.  The results are saved to a Mongo database
and the results are presented in the web browser using the index.html file.  I have included 
screen captures to verify it worked at the time of the scraping.  Since the information 
being scraped changes, I cannot guarantee that in the future the files will work seemlessly.
